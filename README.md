# gdgmoviewrecommender

what i done is that i also trained the model thorugh the workshop and also make the create_model.py to do this model traning on my local machine because the location parametrs of the saved mdoel is not wokring so i need to make the same thing on the local machine after that its just working..

i tried to deploy on the vercel but its not working for now maybe in future i will do some changes and again re build it..

everything is wokring
thanks gdg for this opportunity..
